# Phys 440 HW 1: Sphere And Bounding Box
Calculates the Volume and Surface Area of both a Sphere and Bounding Box generated from a provided radius

Each of the three versions has its own branch:
  - versionOne: poorly written code with hard coded radius value
  - versionTwo: code takes user input and has a bit cleaner UI/organization
  - versionThree: code is well documented and uses classes BoundingBox and Sphere

If something doesn't run correctly, feel free to email me: bpashia@hawk.iit.edu
Thanks!
